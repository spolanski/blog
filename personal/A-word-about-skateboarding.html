  A word about skateboarding

<p>Skateboarding was one of my favourite sports when I was younger. It has changed my life so much that I even wrote a Bachelors Thesis about it. In this thesis, I tried to analyse what is happening with a skateboard deck when a skater lands on it. Looking back in time, I feel that picking this particular topic was a really good move. I was at the very beginning of the simulation learning curve and each tiny step towards my goal took ages. However, having practical experience in skateboarding helped me more than I would have imagined. First of all, I knew where the skateboard usually breaks so it was easier to understand the results. Secondly, I felt like I was contributing somehow to the development of skateboarding and that gave me a lot of satisfaction.</p>

<p>The simulation of skateboard is such a nice example of situation when hobby meets engineering that I decided to present it in my first blog. Unfortunately, I cannot use the model I built for Bachelors Thesis purposes as it was created in software that I currently don’t have access to. I created new one in Abaqus Student version which is available free of charge to students, educators, and researchers for personal and educational use - I believe the educational blog fits well to these requirements.</p>

<h2 id="rectangular-specimen-experiment">Rectangular specimen experiment</h2>
<p>When I started to build the numerical model for thesis purposes, I knew that skateboard deck is a lamina made from Canadian Maple (usually 7-9 plies). The fact that it is a type of material I had not analyse before made my situation a bit problematic. For that reason, I decided to build a model of rectangular specimen at first to see how it behaves. Luckily, I found an old skateboard at home - that allows me to make an experiment on real piece of lamina. The photo was taken during the test performed in professional laboratory built from a home gym set :-) .</p>

<p>The main idea of the experiment was to check the displacement under the given loading. I performed the measurements using a ruler, so the obtained data were probably not as accurate as it should. However, the rough results were enough to know if my numerical model, which I was about to build, would be near to acceptable.
Before I moved to model creation process, I had to find material properties which are crucial in Finite Element Analysis. At that stage, I found a very useful Wood Handbook with Canadian Maple material data (it can be found here https://www.fpl.fs.fed.us/documnts/fplgtr/fpl_gtr190.pdf). Using the data from this resource, I built a shell specimen in Abaqus and I applied the lamina material model to it. After that, I put appropriate restrains and loads to imitate real behaviour of the sample. The results from experiments are presented below.</p>
